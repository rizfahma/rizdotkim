> Do you have any limit on your daily coffee intake?
> Or do you just not drink any coffee at all?

Those two questions have no middle ground in this case.

If you are a human being without any specific condition that prohibits you from drinking coffee, you might be drinking at least a cup of coffee within a week.

This recent years, especially in the last 1 year I have been drinking coffee quite a lot. I even drank at least 4 cups of coffee in a single day. In the office, also at home.

In one of our offices, there's a coffee machine that I think is a blessing to us. Our team bought the bean, so we just need to grind the coffee bean with the machine, also brew the coffee using it.

My favorite thing to do in the morning, after arriving, clocked in on the app, put my backpack down, turned on my laptop, is making a cup of coffee.

My coffee in this particular office, since I make it myself (with the espresso machine obviously) is just a black coffee. No sugar at all, only added a few water to dilute the coffe a bit more. That's it, and I am ready to check emails, to-do lists, chats, etc on my laptop and phone.

Since I have been "practicing" intermittent fasting (it's more than 270 already in less than a year), I don't have any breakfast before my intermittent fasting done. It's not extreme, sometimes I even just did a 12 hours IF. So, that black coffee is my only thing I have beside water in the morning.

## How much coffee again is too much?

Well, according to FDA, it is roughly 4 cups daily that's enough (400 gr of caffeine). But as a mentioned earlier, I even drank at least 4 cups sometimes.

Does it have any effect based on what I feel? 
In terms of healthy issue, uhm I don't think so (yet). Not in a terribly bad way.

> Yes I feel the "heartbeat" too, sometimes it upsets my stomach too, but surprisingly not as much I worried about.

That's why, when I had some overtime at the office that made me stay until late night, I drank at least 3 cups of coffee. Beside to prevent sleepy feeling, often times is that I felt bored and needed some activity other than chitchatting and staring at the monitor.

I just went to the coffee machine, and brew my own one. And yes, that's a black coffee again. At night.

## At home, it's a bit different

I don't have a coffee machine like the one in the office at home. But I have some "instruments" to make coffee in a fun and enjoyable way.

At home I brew my coffee which I manually grinded, and brewed with a moka pot. I don't drink instant coffee like from Nescafe anymore at home.

Well, that thing is amazing! It takes time, but it's fun, and it feels like doing some art. I kid you not!

While waiting my coffee done on the moka pot, I wash the dishes sometimes, and also prepared the cups with some milk.

I used to use some French Press cup to froth the milk, also that takes sometime, but it's part of the art of making coffee with moka pot. But since a week ago, I now use a rechargeable milk frother, so it's not fully manual anymore. It cuts several minutes, from pressing the milk compared to previous way.

I used to add some brown suga plus cinnamon powder, but now I prefer caramel syroup to mix with the coffee and milk. Not to forget to use the frother to mix the whole thing altogether.

**The taste is gooooood.**

### What coffee I usually buy?

Lately I like this Butterscotch sea salt coffee from Family Mart. For me it tastes good, also not that expensive. Sometimes I have Tuku coffee, Fore, Tomoro coffees too. But most of the time, when I want to buy coffee from the vendor, I just have that Butterscotch sea salt from Family Mart.

So, I have been telling you how I enjoy my coffee, how much coffee I usually have in a day, how I make my coffee, and stuff. I know I might have some "side effects" from drinking too much of coffee. The thing I worry much is that diabetic shit and heart attack shit. I am kinda managing it by not adding too much sugar, and maintain my little excercise regularly, so hopefully those risks are minimized.

I don't know about how you enjoy your coffee, but have fun making and enjoying your coffe!

_Cheers!_
