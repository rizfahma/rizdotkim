## Adjustment of Behavior

So, I have been doing I-F (Intermittent Fasting) for about 55 days straight dated since 17th of April 2025. The reason why I am doing it is that I want to lose weight. I have gained tens of kg in the last 5 years or so, and I think it is not going to be good for my health and also my appearance.

If you asked me about this 8 or 10 years ago, I would have been laughed, because it was just a new term to me. In fact I must have not been knowing why I would do that, because losing weight was not a thing to me. I even thought of gaining more weights for my relatively thin body.

### Gaining weight was much more difficult then, than losing it.

But now it's different, that my weight is more than ideal, though not that too much. It is still under 80kg though. However, if I don't pay more attention to it, the chance of losing control of the weight gain would be too much, and it would put more risks to my health and stuff.

So, as I said, I have been gaining weight in the last few years, that I had to wear a slightly larger jeans, shirts, shorts, any clothes basically. Waist, thighs, also my butt are getting larger, that slow me down, and surely less nimbler I must say. Due to these changes, more health risks starting to emerge. Say it lower back pain problems, cardio, and stuff.

**That's why, I have to make some adjustment.**

I started to see some losing weight, fitness, health contents on my youtube, including intermittent fasting ones. Made me consider more to change my behavior.

After Ramadan month this year, I began to do some Syawal fasting, completed 6 days of it, and then I started my intermittent fasting and still going.

#### Is intermittent fasting hard?

Compared to Ramadan fasting, I must say that I-F is not as hard. Why? Because during intermittent fasting, you can actually still drink, but only black coffe or tea without any additions like sugar, also you still can drink water. Still, intermittent fasting still push you to be more disciplined. Because even though you still can drink those drinks I mentioned, there are too much of distractions. Let's say it free snacks in the office, snacks in home, or any culinary contents you accidentally watch in the night, or any time during your intermittent fasting.

#### My intermittent fasting so far

I am not that strict on myself during intermittent fasting. Well, normally intermittent fasting is a 16/8 method. Which is 16 hours of intermittent fasting, and 8 hours of eating window time. Sometimes I even only do like 12 or 13 hours of intermittent fasting, but mostly I do 14-15 hours of it. Although I did some 12-13 hours intermittent fasting, during my eating time window, I don't put that much of calories intake.

Don't make it too hard. We just need to be accustomed to it. If you are already in your 13 hours of intermittent fasting, and you start to get fainted and need some food, why not eat some. Don't discourage yourself. That's still some good achievement.

Maybe some people started to lose momentum when doing intermittent fasting, because they break it in the 12th hours, and after that they think that the rythm broke and think that if it is not 16 hours, then it's not a progress, well please don't discourage yourself.

If you did 12 or 13 hours, that's better than a lot of others. Remember you still can make it the other day.

**Back to my I-F.**

After doing it for about 55 days straight, **I have lost around 3-4 kg of body weight.** And I still have to lose more, so I am not satisfied yet.

Yes I feel that doing the I-F sucks especially when I still have some overtime work to do, and I feel hungry.

Guess what, I have committed already, 3-4 hours gone by, and I don't want to restart it.

Drink some water, prolly my body has to be forced to adjust into fat burning mode, or just consume the meals I have already eaten.

Body needs more adaptation, change of behavior in consuming food. And that takes some time.

It is just probably the beginning of new habit for me.

It has to be done, otherwise the health is getting worse. It is not good already, though.

Cheers to all of you who work on their mind, body in order to be better.
