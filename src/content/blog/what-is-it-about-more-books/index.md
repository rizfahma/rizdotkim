### New solution or just Adding More to the piles

Maybe we are just having more and more of excuses when we stuck with any problem in our life.

I think it happens to me too, that when I have some "blockers" in my mind, and browse the internet, there's a chance that I would see some contents with references to books. Or let's say the figures with those inspiring thoughts, are just two clicks away from finding books related to them.

I have quite a lot of books that I have been accumulating since years ago, especially during COVID period. I still have some books from that period that I haven't read yet.

_Yet, I still have the desire to buy more books._

I've promised to myself that I wouldn't buy any more book(s) before I finished reading all my books.

Well, I tried it before, and failed. Bought a few books, and haven't finished them, but I read several chapters though.

We all have those thought of finish reading the books we dreamt of reading for a long time.

The excitement of receiving the package of book we just ordered feels like a new hope.

> The hope of promise.  
> The promise of acquiring new knowledge.  
> The knowledge that we believe will turn our life around.
> 
> In a short time.

Must be like some dope.

#### But it was just too good to be truth.

All those social media contents that lead us to acquire more and more books, that we even allocate a few percent of our monthly budget to buy another one.

It's just another book, that the excitement feels like evaporating when we get lost between pages, chapters, and that we feel some of those hopes were just false promises, then fading away.

**We feel like we betrayed ourselves, and it was just barely 5% of the book.**

And somehow we started to make another promise, to not buy another until we finish the pile of the unread ones.

After all, if you are looking it in a big picture, you could start thinking that one of the reasons why you bought the books was that you thought it could be the solutions or the answers to your questions.

Maybe about how you could be more productive, more successful, and so on.

But actually, all those issues are not solved by just buying books.

That's why, before even thinking of buying any more book, we must resist and take a look of the current piles of unread books.

### Surprise!

Oh wait, my new book just arrived.

I guess I am gonna be having some more precious knowledge to acquire. Or am I not?

Have a great time reading, fellas!
