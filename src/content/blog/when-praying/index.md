### Mind Wanders

During Ramadan, muslims pray a lot more. Including me, despite I realize that I am not super religious. But I don't want to waste the holy month, missing the opportunities to pray more than usual.

We have terawih / taraweeh prayers in the evening, usually started around 19.45, and finished around 20.30 here in my neighborhood.

I enjoy doing this prayers although sometimes it is not that easy, as your body have been tired already after fasting the whole day while still working or doing regular tasks. Ramadan month is full of challenges, your spiritualilty is being tested, not solely phisically and emotionally. That's why it is said that only the ones who are faithful or let's say it is addressed to believers. Please correct me if I am wrong, though.

**Back to the taraweeh prayers,**

There's a huge difference doing these prayers alone in the house and in the mosque, at least from my perspective. I know that praying in the mosque rewards more deeds compared to doing it alone in the house. But experience wise, for me it is significantly felt better doing it in the mosque. Sadly this Ramadan I did it a lot more often in the house. Have so many things to do actually.

When doing taraweeh prayers in the mosque, at least we interact with others, meet different people, listen to some preach, reflecting more and deeper about our life, and so on and so forth. Sometimes I can't believe that we are here already, and will be missing this month just in two weeks, ten days, five days, two days, and suddenly, tomorrow is the last day of Ramadan, and you feel that you haven't done much yet. I am afraid that it also goes for life itself.

During taraweeh prayers, I don't know about you, fellas, but sometimes my mind wanders like it's getting more active having random thoughts, ideas, plans, or whatever.

I would love that happens if I really need it, like when I want to write or work on something. But during taraweeh? Not that good. Sometimes when my mind wanders, I feel like it would be better if I could record the whole thoughts emerge and select which ones worth doing and see the results.

### Must be cool if I can make some of those things work.

But let's remember that focus on taraweeh prayers is a must than letting our mind wanders uncontrollably.

Are we failed if our mind wanders while we are praying? well, I am not a preacher and I am not that super religious. But I think it is normal when suddenly our mind wanders for like a few second. When we realize we are in that state of mind, lt's better we force our mind to get back on the prayers.

We are not perfect, but we got to do it. I believe God is Great, and I believe He rewards the ones who strive.

Happy Ramadan. Have a blessed moments.
