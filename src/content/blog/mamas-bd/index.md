summary: "A birthday reflection on never giving enough to Mom: the guilt and love that drives me to do better"
---

As I previously written about [birthday](https://riz.kim/another-day-of-another-year/)s, we don't "really" celebrate it among our family. But this time, or to my Mom, there should be some exception. Well, we didn't celebrate it though.

Sometimes I thought that I haven't given the best to my Mama, and I would always regret it.

That's why every birthday of her in the recent years, I tried to do something.

Not in some exaggerration though, but giving her some "gift" was the minimum I could. Mama is not that kind of person who demands so much, like asking this or that, though.

Happy birthday to my Dear Mama.

Sorry I wasn't there, Mama.

Love.

\*PS: today is not Mama's birthday.
