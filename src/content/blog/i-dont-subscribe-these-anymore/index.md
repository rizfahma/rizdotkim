summary: "Why I canceled Netflix and Spotify: fighting subscription fatigue and switching to YouTube Premium"

### Not only just for the increasing price

The main issue of the current online services is the price that keep increasing. They started by charging free, introducing freemium, premium, and then raising the price. I know it took much investment in order to create demands for their services, including educating people on how to enjoy their services, etc.

\[Update\] Wait... I heard Netflix even planned to put ads on the platform despite subscribing. Well, that would make people leave them more quickly.

But those days have gone away. People are getting more familiar with online services, how those can provide entertainment, creating solutions, etc. And people loved them so much for the relatively affordable cost at the beginning.

We were introduced to legit streaming services like Netflix, Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO Max, Disney+, and so on, that are actually worked well to reduce content piracy, since people find them really convenient.

#### Yes I am still price sensitive!

Like I implied before, people started using those services for the relatively affordable price, including me.

I used to subscribed to Spotify, and also Netflix for years. I chose the family or group package, so I could share those with my relatives and friends.

However, after several changes, including on the pricing stand point, in which it's getting more expensive, I decided to stop subscribing, or switching to other services.

That's why I decided to unsubscribe from Netflix few years ago, and then unsubbed from Spotify Premium a few months ago.

It was not that easy, since I always used Spotify Premium for hours on a daily basis. For Netflix, I didn't really use it that often, because I didn't have much spare time to watch movies or series due to work and other more important things.

Netflix was getting more expensive, didn't justify the price for me, while I only watched so much less of the service.

Spotify was also getting a little bit more expensive, and despite I used it much much more than Netflix, the main reason was different.

I could actually enjoy music streaming provided by YouTube Music, with comparable price but with tons of music catalogs as well. Plus the YouTube ecosystem makes it easier to track my Likes, history, and stuff. Thus I choose YouTube premium, replacing Spotify.

Now at least I could save a little bit on the online service department, and actually it doesn't bother me that much, stepping away from Netflix and Spotify.

I am sure you can also simplify your subscriptions!
