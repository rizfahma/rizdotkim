## Mixed Feelings

I have these feelings whenever I re-read my own blogposts. Mostly feeling of nervous. Or at worst: disgusted. LoL

I often don't plan to go deliberately to my blog and say:  
"oh let's find some inspirations by reading my own blogposts from 10 years ago."

Nah.

I avoid that, instead.

Why?

I feel ashamed, and even confused sometimes. Sometimes if I randomly see some related posts below my blogposts and open it, I was thinking and asking myself, what the heaven happened that day? Why did I write this post and decided to hit the publish button?

Sometimes I asked myself:  
"this posts sound so stupehd, let's erase these thang and ask God for forgiveness."

I couldn't do that to all those posts though.

Even though I felt ashamed sometimes, but I felt that I betrayed myself if I deleted all those posts. Those were parts of my thinking processes, development process might be too.

I might have felt that those writings were the accumulation of feelings, experiences that took part of my life that time.

I might not have the best way of expressing it to public, so I felt safe to express it in certain ways. Here.

Why this suddenly becomes this melancholy, man?

LoL

Appreciating ourselves is important, especially in these days when nobody does so.

Don't forget to visit your multi-years old posts to remind you the journey you have taken of long.

Cheers!
