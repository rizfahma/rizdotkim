### I have been talking about it

I don't understand why some companies rely on Instagram that much. Yes I understand that it has billions of users worldwide, thus it could be useful for marketing use. Might be for promoting their products, seeing people's reaction on their new campaigns, or using it for PR purposes. You name it.

As [someone who doesn't have any personal account](https://riz.kim/no-instagram-no-facebook/), sometimes I found it challenging whenever the company representatives ask us to check some important news or updates on the instagram account.

Oh no.

Oh yeah, it is not only internally though. Some startups also do the same. Sometimes I couldn't participate to their invitation to like their instagram page in order to earn their free gift.

_Heaven_ no.

I always ask them if it is possible to just like their posts on twitter, as I mainly use it. And most of the time the look of their face says "_uh oh, twitter account not found_".

**What a shame.**

Sometimes I wonder, why don't they just put those info on, let's say a web page instead of forcing us to follow them on their instagram page? Not everyone has instagram account.

Is everybody so lazy now, not willing to add those infos on web page? Or maybe no other better alternatives than tha holy instagram page? Oh yeah I know that Meta invest billions of dollars to make people stick to their platform, like instagram, but still... I don't like instagram.

If you wonder why I do so, please go down in the rabbit hole of "Cambridge Analytica" and other privacy issues on Meta's platform. Not trying to convince you to delete your instagram and facebook accounts though. It's your choice.

Will I ever signup for personal instagram account again in the future? I have no idea. If so, that would make me more distracted and overwhelmed.

I felt so relieved after [deleting my facebook](https://riz.kim/delete-facebook/) and instagram accounts 6 years ago.
